# Contact Manager

## Overview

The Contact Manager is a simple web application built using React.js that allows users to input and store contact information, including a person's name and email address. This project serves as a basic example of how to create a web application with React.js, manage state, and display data dynamically on a webpage.

## Features

- **Add Contacts**: Users can enter a person's name and email address and click the "Add Contact" button to store the information.

- **List Contacts**: All added contacts are displayed in a list on the webpage, showing the name and email address of each contact.
